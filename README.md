## What is this?

This is a Jekyll-based website for the MODEVAR 2020 workshop. This repository comprises templates and files with the content. The real website is generated from these files using the [Jekyll static-website generator](https://jekyllrb.com) and the [minimal mistakes template](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes).

The MODEVAR website is deployed in [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Authors can create new content using [Prose](http://prose.io/), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or the [Github](https://github.com) web interface. This repository must be cloned/forked only for development.

This site is inspired in [AcademicPages/events](https://github.com/academicpages/events), a fork from the [minimal mistakes template](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes). 

## Local installation for development

You can install Jekyll on your computer to preview the changes before pushing them to the Github repository.

1. Install Jekyll pre-requisites, including the Ruby language

   ```
   sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
   ``` 

2. Configure the Ruby language to install software in the `$HOME` directory 

   ```
   echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```
